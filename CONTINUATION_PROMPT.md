# Continuation Prompt for meterr.ai Development

## Project Status Summary

I'm continuing work on the **meterr.ai** project - an AI expense tracking platform that monitors usage and costs across multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.). 

### Last Session Accomplishments

We completed extensive overnight research using a multi-agent system that validated the market opportunity and built initial prototypes.

## What Was Completed

### 1. Technology Stack Research & Decisions

**Final Stack Recommendations:**
- **Authentication**: Clerk (MVP phase) → Supabase Auth (at scale)
- **Database**: Supabase (core data) + DynamoDB (high-volume AI analytics)
- **Infrastructure**: Vercel (already configured)
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Architecture**: Edge proxy pattern for AI routing and tracking

### 2. Market Validation & Positioning

**Key Findings:**
- Position as "CloudFlare for AI APIs" - smart proxy that optimizes costs
- Validated pricing tiers:
  - Free: Limited usage for exploration
  - Pro: $50-75/month (individuals & small teams)
  - Team: $200-300/month (collaboration features)
  - Enterprise: Custom pricing
- Shifted from speculative claims ("67% of companies...") to provable features
- Focus on real value: unified dashboard, smart routing, team analytics

### 3. Prototypes Built

Successfully created 5 working prototypes:

| Prototype | Location | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|----------|---------|--------|
| AI Expense Dashboard | `apps/app/app/dashboard/ai-expenses` | Real-time cost tracking | ✅ Completed |
| Smart Router API | `apps/app/app/api/smart-router` | Optimal model selection | ✅ Completed |
| Token Optimizer | `apps/app/app/tools/token-optimizer` | Reduce token usage | ✅ Completed |
| Budget Alert System | `apps/app/app/api/alerts` | Spending notifications | ✅ Completed |
| Team Analytics | `apps/app/components/team-analytics` | Department tracking | ✅ Completed |

### 4. Research Artifacts Created

**Key Documents:**
- `/research-results/validated-insights.md` - Skeptically validated market research
- `/research-results/product-specification.md` - Product roadmap and features
- `/research-results/pricing-implementation-guide.md` - Pricing strategy
- `/.claude/context/research-findings.md` - Technology stack recommendations
- `/prototypes/build-report.json` - Prototype implementation status

**Implementation Scripts:**
- Multiple TypeScript agents in `/apps/app/scripts/`
- SDK prototypes for Node.js and Python in `/apps/app/sdk-prototype/`
- Gateway comparison implementations in `/apps/app/gateway-prototype/`

## Environment Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lfriedbauer/meterr.git
cd meterr

# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

### 2. Check Environment

```bash
# Verify environment
git status
node --version  # Should be 18+ 
pnpm --version  # Should be 8+

# Check current branch
git branch
```

### 3. Review Key Files

```bash
# Review validated research
cat research-results/validated-insights.md

# Check prototype status
cat prototypes/build-report.json

# Review tech stack decisions
cat .claude/context/research-findings.md
```

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Today)
1. **Test Prototypes with Real Data**
   - Set up test API keys (use `.env.example` as template)
   - Run the prototypes with actual API calls
   - Validate token counting accuracy

2. **Set Up Authentication**
   - Create Clerk account and get API keys
   - Implement Clerk in the Next.js app
   - Set up user onboarding flow

3. **Configure Database**
   - Set up Supabase project
   - Create initial schema for:
     - Users and teams
     - API key management
     - Usage tracking
     - Budget alerts

### Short-term (This Week)
4. **Implement Core Features**
   - Connect prototypes to real database
   - Build API proxy middleware
   - Create dashboard UI with shadcn/ui
   - Implement real-time usage tracking

5. **Set Up Payments**
   - Configure Stripe account
   - Implement subscription tiers
   - Add usage-based billing logic

6. **Testing & Optimization**
   - Write tests for critical paths
   - Optimize token counting algorithms
   - Test multi-provider routing

### Medium-term (Next 2 Weeks)
7. **Polish & Launch MVP**
   - Refine UI/UX based on testing
   - Add documentation
   - Set up monitoring (Vercel Analytics)
   - Prepare for Product Hunt launch

## Known Issues

1. **Windows "nul" file**: There's a problematic file named "nul" in the root directory that couldn't be committed (Windows reserved filename). Can be safely ignored or deleted.

2. **Line Endings**: Some files show CRLF warnings on Windows. This is normal and doesn't affect functionality.

3. **API Keys**: The `.env.example` file has placeholder keys. You'll need to get real API keys for testing.

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev           # Run all apps
pnpm dev:app       # Run main app only
pnpm dev:marketing # Run marketing site

# Building
pnpm build         # Build all
pnpm test          # Run tests
pnpm lint          # Lint code

# Deployment (when ready)
pnpm deploy:app
pnpm deploy:marketing
```

## Architecture Overview

```
User Request → Meterr Proxy → AI Provider APIs
                    ↓
              Token Tracking
                    ↓
              Cost Analytics
                    ↓
               Dashboard UI
```

## Questions to Address

Based on the research, these questions need answers:

1. **Which features to prioritize for MVP?**
   - Token tracking is core
   - Should we include team features in MVP?
   - How sophisticated should smart routing be initially?

2. **Customer Acquisition Strategy?**
   - Product Hunt launch planned
   - Should we focus on solopreneurs or small teams first?
   - What integrations are critical (Slack, Zapier)?

3. **Technical Decisions?**
   - Should we start with Clerk or go straight to Supabase Auth?
   - How to handle the DynamoDB integration for high-volume tracking?
   - WebSocket vs polling for real-time updates?

## Ready to Continue!

Use this prompt to get started:

```
I'm picking up work on the meterr.ai project. I've cloned the repo and installed dependencies. 

Please help me:
1. Verify my environment is set up correctly
2. Review the current state of the prototypes
3. Begin implementing the next priority items from the roadmap

The goal is to have a working MVP that can track AI costs across providers and provide smart routing recommendations.
