# Strategic Pivot Questions for LLMs

## Value Discovery Questions

### Customer Pain Points
1. "What are the top 5 most expensive operational problems that fractional CXOs, solopreneurs, accountants, attorneys, and mid-size companies (under $250M in revenue) face that could be solved with our tools? Review all resources at our disposal:
   - Tools directory: C:\Users\Owner\Projects\meterr\tools (n8n, Langfuse, Socket.io server, monitoring stack)
   - App capabilities: C:\Users\Owner\Projects\meterr\apps\app (OpenLLMetry, Recharts, TanStack Table, shadcn/ui, React Hook Form, real-time alerts)
   - Installed packages: Intro.js (onboarding), Lightweight Charts (financial data), AG Grid (enterprise tables), Anime.js (animations), CSV/Excel export
   - Review development-guide.md for complete listing of available infrastructure"

2. "Given our tools (OpenLLMetry, Langfuse, real-time alerts, data tables handling millions of rows), what B2B SaaS product would provide immediate ROI within 24 hours of installation? Requirements:
   - Must integrate with existing tools customers already use (QuickBooks, Stripe, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Salesforce, etc.)
   - CSV upload for testing is acceptable but production must have API/webhook integrations
   - Consider n8n's 400+ pre-built integrations as available connectors"

3. "What repetitive tasks do companies with 2+ employees waste the most money on that could be automated with n8n workflows and real-time monitoring? Focus on tasks that:
   - Happen daily/weekly
   - Currently require manual data entry or checking
   - Involve multiple tools that don't talk to each other
   - Cause expensive errors when done incorrectly"

### Market Opportunities
4. "What are the fastest-growing B2B markets where real-time data visualization and alerts would command premium pricing ($500+ per month per seat)?"

5. "Which industries have compliance requirements that necessitate detailed audit trails and real-time monitoring (perfect for our Langfuse + OpenLLMetry stack)?"

6. "What existing successful SaaS products could we clone and enhance with our superior real-time capabilities and data handling (TanStack Table with virtualization)?"

## Platform Pivot Ideas

### Beyond AI Cost Tracking
7. "Using our exact tech stack, design 3 different B2B platforms that have nothing to do with AI but leverage: real-time alerts, massive data tables, beautiful dashboards, and workflow automation"

8. "What high-value business metrics (not AI-related) need real-time tracking where 1% improvement equals $10,000+ saved monthly?"

9. "Which business departments have budget for tools but lack good solutions for real-time collaboration and monitoring?"

### Consulting-First Approach
10. "What consulting services could we offer where the platform is just a delivery mechanism for expertise (think McKinsey with a dashboard)?"

11. "What business intelligence questions do CEOs ask daily that our real-time dashboard could answer instantly?"

12. "Design a 'Business Health Monitor' platform using our tools that would make any CEO sign up immediately"

## Technical Leverage Questions

### Quick Win Features
16. "What single dashboard view would save a manager 2 hours daily if they had real-time data instead of waiting for reports?"

17. "Using our animation capabilities (Anime.js) and charts (Recharts), what data story could we tell that would wow executives in a demo?"

18. "What integrations with existing tools (via n8n) would make our platform indispensable on day one?"

## Revenue Model Questions

### Immediate Value
19. "Design a freemium model where the free tier provides value in 5 minutes, and the paid tier is irresistible after 1 day of use"

20. "What per-transaction or per-event pricing model could we implement that scales with customer success (they only pay when they save/earn)?"

21. "Which features should be in Phase 1 (MVP) to get paying customers vs Phase 2 (scale) vs Phase 3 (enterprise)?"
