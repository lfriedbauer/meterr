## Objectives
- Compare authentication solutions (Supabase, Clerk, Auth0, NextAuth, Cognito)
- Analyze multi-tenant capabilities
- Evaluate enterprise features (SSO, SAML, SCIM)
- Calculate costs at different scales
- Assess migration complexity
- Review security features and compliance

## Research Findings (In Progress)

### Supabase Auth

## Preliminary Recommendation

For meterr.ai's requirements:

**Short-term (MVP)**: **Clerk**
- Fastest time to market
- Best developer experience
- Beautiful UI out of the box
- Multi-tenant ready

**Long-term (Scale)**: Consider migrating to **Supabase Auth** or **NextAuth**
- More cost effective at scale
- Better control
- Avoid vendor lock-in

## Questions for Orchestrator
1. Is enterprise SSO a launch requirement or future feature?
2. What's the budget for authentication at 100K users?
3. How important is the pre-built UI vs custom?
4. Do we need social logins at launch?

## Next Steps
- Create comparison matrix with scores
- Build simple POC with top 2 choices
- Analyze migration paths between solutions
- Get feedback from database-researcher on integration
