  "final_recommendation": "## **\"Pay What You Save\" Model**\n\n**One sentence:** You pay 20% of what Meterr saves you each month - if we save you nothing, you pay nothing.\n\n### How It Works:\n\n1. **Free Setup & First Month:** Full access to establish your baseline costs\n2. **Automatic Savings Calculation:** Meterr tracks your cloud spend reduction vs. baseline\n3. **Simple Monthly Invoice:** 20% of verified savings (capped at $5,000/month)\n4. **Minimum Threshold:** No payment if savings are under $100/month\n\n### Why This Is Revolutionary:\n\n**Perfect Alignment:** \n- We only succeed when you save money\n- The more we save you, the more we earn\n- No risk - you're always 80% ahead\n\n**Completely Fair:**\n- Small startups pay little (small savings = small fee)\n- Large enterprises pay more (huge savings = larger fee)\n- But EVERYONE keeps 80% of savings\n\n**Memorable Hook:**\n*\"Keep 80% of everything we save you. If we don't save you money, we don't make money.\"*\n\n### Example Scenarios:\n- Save $500/month → Pay $100\n- Save $10,000/month → Pay $2,000\n- Save $0 → Pay $0\n- Save $30,000/month → Pay $5,000 (capped)\n\n**The Killer Feature:** Dashboard shows real-time \"You've Saved\" vs \"You've Paid\" metrics - always showing you're winning 4:1."
