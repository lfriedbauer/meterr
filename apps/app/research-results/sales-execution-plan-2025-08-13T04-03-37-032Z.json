  "emailSequence": "## Email 1 (Day 1): Introduction + Value\n\n**Subject:** Your OpenAI bill made me do a double-take\n\nHey [Name],\n\nJust helped a startup cut their Claude API costs by 67% without changing a single feature. Their CTO literally said \"I had no idea we were bleeding this much money.\"\n\nHere's what's probably happening with your AI spend right now:\n- Redundant API calls eating 30-40% of your budget\n- Zero caching strategy (the expensive way to run AI)\n- Token optimization? What's that?\n\nI've audited 50+ companies spending $10K-$100K/month on AI APIs. The average company is overspending by at least $4,000 monthly. That's a senior developer's salary going up in smoke.\n\nQuick question - when's the last time someone actually looked under the hood of your AI implementation? Not just the features, but the actual efficiency?\n\nIf the answer is \"never\" or \"not recently,\" I'd like to offer you a free AI cost audit (normally $1,500). Takes about a week, and you'll get a detailed breakdown of exactly where you're hemorrhaging cash.\n\nInterested?\n\n-[Your name]\n\nP.S. One client found $18K/month in savings. They bought their entire team new MacBooks with the first month's savings. Just saying.\n\n---\n\n## Email 2 (Day 4): Case Study + Social Proof\n\n**Subject:** How Datawise went from $47K to $19K/month (same AI features)\n\nHey [Name],\n\nRemember that startup I mentioned? Here's the full story:\n\nDatawise was burning $47K/month on OpenAI. Their CTO, Marcus, thought it was just \"the cost of doing AI.\" Then we did an audit.\n\nWhat we found:\n- ðŸ”´ 8 million unnecessary tokens from repeated context\n- ðŸ”´ GPT-4 used for tasks GPT-3.5 could handle\n- ðŸ”´ Zero prompt caching (ouch)\n- ðŸ”´ Retry logic causing 3x API calls on errors\n\nThe fix took their dev team 2 weeks to implement. New monthly bill: $19,200.\n\nMarcus texted me last week: \"Board thinks I'm a hero. Used the savings to hire two more engineers.\"\n\nBut here's what really matters - they didn't sacrifice anything:\n- Same response times\n- Same accuracy\n- Actually BETTER error handling\n\nI've got 3 spots left for free audits this month. The audit reveals:\n- Your exact overspend percentage\n- Line-by-line optimization opportunities  \n- Implementation roadmap your team can follow\n- ROI timeline (usually 3-4 weeks to break even)\n\nWant one of those spots? Just reply \"AUDIT\" and I'll send over a quick form.\n\n-[Your name]\n\nP.S. Another CTO told me: \"I was skeptical about the free audit - figured it was a sales trap. Nope. Got $12K in actionable savings with zero obligation. Honestly felt guilty NOT hiring you after that.\"\n\n---\n\n## Email 3 (Day 7): Final Offer + Urgency\n\n**Subject:** Last chance (closing the free audit offer Friday)\n\nHey [Name],\n\nReal talk - I've sent you two emails about potentially saving your company thousands per month on AI costs.\n\nIf you're not interested, totally cool. But I'd hate for you to miss out just because you're busy.\n\nHere's the deal:\nâœ… Free AI cost audit (normally $1,500)\nâœ… Takes 15 minutes of your time to start\nâœ… Average client finds $4K-15K monthly savings\nâœ… You get the full report even if we never talk again\n\nThe catch? I'm closing this offer Friday. Honestly, I'm booked through Q2 and need to focus on paid engagements.\n\nOne last data point: Yesterday, a CTO at a Series B startup discovered they were spending $8,300/month on AI calls that returned empty responses. Their monitoring didn't catch it. Our audit did.\n\nIf you want in, here's my calendar: [calendar link]\n\nGrab 15 minutes and let's see what we find. Worst case? You waste 15 minutes. Best case? You're the hero who just freed up six figures in the budget.\n\nYour call.\n\n-[Your name]\n\nP.S. If you're thinking \"we'll optimize this ourselves eventually\" - sure, but \"eventually\" at $10K+/month gets expensive fast. One client waited 6 months to optimize. Cost them $72,000 in overspend. Don't be that guy.",
