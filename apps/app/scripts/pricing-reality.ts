  // The brutal question

For an AI expense tracking tool (tracks OpenAI, Claude, etc. costs):
- Free tier, Pro $50-75/mo, Team $200-300/mo, Enterprise custom

Critical questions:
1. WHO exactly pays $200/month for this? Give me a specific job title and company profile.
2. A company spending $500/month on AI - would they pay $200/month to track it? Why/why not?
3. A company spending $10,000/month on AI - would they pay $200/month or demand enterprise pricing?
4. What's the ACTUAL price point where this becomes a no-brainer purchase?
5. Reality check: Is this a vitamin (nice to have) or painkiller (must have)?

Don't sugarcoat it. What's the truth about this pricing model?`;

- Datadog: $15-23/host/month
- Spreadsheet: FREE

Why would anyone pay us $200/month when they can:
1. Use provider dashboards for free
2. Track in a spreadsheet for free
3. Build a dashboard in 1 day of dev time

What's our REAL differentiator that justifies the price?`;
