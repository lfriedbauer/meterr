# Meterr.ai Final Pricing Strategy

## The Model: "Pay What You Save" 

### Core Principle
**"Keep 80% of everything we save you. If we don't save you money, we don't make money."**

## How It Works

### 1. Free Start (Month 1)
- Full platform access
- Chrome extension
- API tracking
- Establish baseline costs
- Identify optimization opportunities
- **You pay: $0**

### 2. Savings Mode (Month 2+)
- We track your actual savings vs baseline
- You pay 20% of verified savings
- Payment capped at $5,000/month
- No savings = no payment
- **You always keep 80% of savings**

## Why This Is Different

### Traditional SaaS Problems:
- ❌ Arbitrary tiers (Starter/Growth/Enterprise)
- ❌ Pay regardless of value received
- ❌ Features locked behind paywalls
- ❌ Price increases as you grow

### Our Solution:
- ✅ One model for everyone
- ✅ Pay only when you save
- ✅ All features included
- ✅ Price scales with value delivered

- We save them: $4,500/month (30% optimization)

### Enterprise (Spending $100K/month on AI)

## The Anti-Pitch

We don't have:

- Long-term contracts

We just have one question:
**"Would you like to keep 80% of your AI cost savings?"**

## Implementation

### Website Copy:
**Headline:** "We Only Make Money When You Save Money"
**Subhead:** "Keep 80% of everything we save on your AI costs. Zero risk."
**CTA:** "Start Saving (Free for 30 Days)"

### Sales Script:
"Unlike other tools that charge you $200/month whether they work or not, we only get paid when we save you money. You keep 80% of the savings, we keep 20%. If we save you nothing, you pay nothing. Want to see your potential savings?"

### Objection Handler:
- **"Too good to be true?"** → "That's why the first month is free. See the savings first."
- **"How do I know it's accurate?"** → "Full transparency. Every calculation shown in dashboard."
- **"What's the catch?"** → "No catch. We're betting we can save you money. If we can't, we don't deserve to be paid."

## Why This Wins

1. **Zero Risk:** Customer can't lose
2. **Perfect Alignment:** Our success = their success
3. **Simple Story:** Easy to understand and explain
4. **Fair Scaling:** Small companies pay little, big companies pay more (but save more)
5. **Memorable:** "Keep 80% of savings" sticks in the mind

## The One-Liner
