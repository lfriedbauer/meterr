## Questions to Avoid Leading

❌ "This is better than Helicone, right?"
✅ "How does this compare to what you use today?"

## Prototype Adjustments for Testing

### A/B Test Elements
1. **Naming Test**
   - Version A: "AI Profitability Dashboard"
   - Version B: "AI ROI Command Center"

2. **Color Scheme Test**
   - Version A: Green (current)
   - Version B: Purple (alternative)

3. **Pricing Display Test**
   - Version A: Hide pricing initially
   - Version B: Show "Start free, from $49/month"

## Success Criteria
- 70% understand profitability concept within 2 minutes
- 50% express "this is what we need" sentiment
- 30% willing to pay >$99/month
- 80% see clear differentiation from competitors
- 60% would recommend to colleagues

## Contingency Plans

### If No Real Users Available
1. **Competitor Review Mining**

   - Document feature requests in forums

2. **Synthetic Testing**
   - Create personas based on LinkedIn profiles
   - Walk through scenarios as each persona
   - Document likely friction points

3. **Expert Review**
   - Find AI consultants for feedback
   - Reach out to AI influencers
   - Get developer advocate opinions

## Post-Testing Actions
1. Compile feedback into actionable insights
2. Prioritize feature requests by frequency
3. Adjust positioning based on language used
4. Refine pricing based on willingness to pay
5. Create iteration plan for Phase 4

## Documentation Requirements
- Record all sessions (with permission)
- Transcribe key quotes verbatim
- Screenshot confusion points
- Track all metrics in spreadsheet
- Create highlight reel of reactions

## Ethical Considerations
- Obtain consent for recording
- Clarify prototype vs. production
- Don't promise features not built
- Protect participant data
- Offer early access as thank you
