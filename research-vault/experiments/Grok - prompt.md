Executive Summary

Company: meterr.ai - AI cost optimization platform



Mission: To empower businesses and individuals as a hybrid consultant + platform, distinguishing ourselves as leaders in finance and AI by optimizing AI costs through intelligent tracking, routing, and advisory services. (To be refined based on research, emphasizing finance-AI intersection.)



Revenue Model: Hybrid consultant + platform; validate through pricing study comparing "Pay What You Save" vs. usage-based vs. subscription models, with hybrids incorporating consulting services (e.g., custom optimizations, financial advisory on AI spend).



Target Launch: MVP validation with initial customers, building on existing prototype (token tracking, smart router, dashboard).

Strategic Context

We're exploring pricing models with a focus on hybrids that blend platform usage with consulting services to differentiate as finance-AI experts. Prioritize models that allow for ongoing advisory (e.g., quarterly reviews of AI spend efficiency).

Pure Models:



Model A - "Pay What You Save": 20% of verified AI cost savings.

Model B - Usage-Based + Markup: Pass-through costs + 5-15% markup.

Model C - Hybrid Subscription: $49/month with usage caps.

Model D - Pure Subscription: Fixed tiers.



Hybrid Combinations to Test (Emphasizing Consultant + Platform):



Model E - Choice Menu: Customers choose between options, with add-on consulting.

Model F - Graduated Hybrid: Start with usage/markup, graduate to "Pay What You Save" + consulting retainer.

Model G - Segmented Pricing: Tailored by persona (e.g., usage for solopreneurs, success fee + consulting for enterprises).

Model H - Base + Success: $29 base + 10% savings + optional consulting hours.

Model I - Credits System: Prepaid credits for platform use or consulting sessions.



Enterprise Services: Custom implementations, optimization consulting, and financial AI audits to position as industry leaders.

Execution Protocol

As CEO, instruct Orchestrator Agent to coordinate using existing agent profiles (in .claude/agents/). All documentation must modify existing files in docs-portal/docs/ or docs-portal/ai-docs/ (unified source of truth per best practices: single doc with audience views, versioned in Git). Do not create new files/folders unless explicitly approved; incorporate into existing (e.g., append to MVP\_SPEC.md if exists, or create minimally under docs-portal/ with Git commit). Follow Docusaurus structure for docs. Use \[date] as YYYY-MM-DD (current: 2025-08-14).

Phase 1: Market Discovery \& Customer Profiling

Step 1: Research Question Development



To: Research Coordinator + Marketing Agent

Task: Develop questions on demographics (expanded to include hybrid service needs, e.g., consulting preferences), features (beyond tracking: financial reporting, ROI tools), platform flexibility.

Output: Modify docs-portal/docs/research-questions.md (or create if absent, but prefer modify).



Step 2: Competitor Discovery \& Analysis



To: Marketing Agent + Skeptic Agent + Research Coordinator

Task: Discover/analyze competitors (direct: OpenMeter, Helicone, etc.; adjacent: Datadog; alternatives: in-house/spreadsheets). Deep analysis on top 5-7, including how they lack hybrid consulting.

Output: Update docs-portal/docs/competitor-discovery.md and docs-portal/docs/competitor-analysis.md.



Step 3: Market Research \& Persona Development (PUBLIC SOURCES ONLY)



To: Research Coordinator + Marketing Agent

Task: Use public forums (Reddit/HN/X with links/screenshots), competitor reviews (G2/ProductHunt), industry reports. Build hypothesis personas marked "HYPOTHESIS"; estimate for hybrid fit. No fake data.

Output: Update docs-portal/docs/personas-hypotheses.md; evidence in docs-portal/evidence/ subfolders.



Phase 2: Feature Prioritization \& Platform Evolution

Step 4: Platform Assessment \& Pivot Analysis



To: Product Manager + Architect + Builder

Task: Evaluate existing build (token tracking, router, dashboard) vs. market; consider pivots to support hybrid (e.g., consulting dashboards). Use decision framework: keep/modify/kill/build.

Output: Modify docs-portal/docs/platform-pivot.md.



Step 5: MVP Redefinition



To: Product Manager + Skeptic

Task: Redefine MVP based on research; options include hybrid value props (e.g., cost tracker + consulting tools). Define must-haves/nice-to-haves.

Output: Update single MVP spec in docs-portal/docs/mvp-spec.md (unified "bible" for MVP; avoid multiples).



Phase 3: Prototype Validation

Step 6: Adaptive Prototyping



To: Builder + Product Design Agent

Task: Modify existing prototype (in apps/) based on findings; focus on hybrid features. Provide Vercel URLs.

Output: Update docs-portal/docs/prototypes.md with rationale/URLs; commit changes to Git.



Step 7: User Testing (EVIDENCE-BASED)



To: Customer Success Agent + Research Coordinator

Task: If no users, create test plan using competitor insights; mark "PLANNED". For real: document evidence.

Output: Update docs-portal/docs/user-testing.md; sessions/plans in subfolders.



Step 8: Iteration



To: Builder + Product Manager

Task: Refine based on feedback; commit with descriptions.



Phase 4: Go-to-Market Strategy \& Validation

Step 9: Comprehensive Pricing Study with Hybrid Models



To: Marketing Agent + Product Manager + Skeptic Agent + Data Engineer

Task: Test pure/hybrids with consultant elements; model profitability (use code\_execution for simulations: break-even, success rates 30-70%, costs). Use public data for inferences; mark "SIMULATION".

Output: Update docs-portal/docs/pricing-hybrid-study.md.



Step 10: Go-to-Market Strategy Development



To: Marketing Agent + Architect + Operations Engineer

Task: Decide open source vs. private; distribution; acquisition. Emphasize hybrid positioning.

Output: Modify docs-portal/docs/go-to-market.md.



Step 11: Customer Segmentation \& Tier Definition



To: Customer Success Agent + Marketing Agent + Data Engineer

Task: Define tiers; assess LTV/CAC for hybrids.

Output: Update docs-portal/docs/customer-segments.md.



Phase 5: Documentation \& Synthesis

Step 12: Final Report (EVIDENCE-BASED)



To: Scribe Agent + Skeptic Agent + Marketing Agent + Data Engineer

Task: Synthesize with sources/confidence levels; next steps for real validation.

Output: Single report in docs-portal/docs/market-validation-report.md; evidence folder.



Step 13: Mission Statement Development



To: Orchestrator + Marketing Agent

Task: Craft/refine mission emphasizing hybrid finance-AI leadership.

Output: Update docs-portal/docs/mission-statement.md.



Validation Requirements

Anti-Hallucination Protocol (Strengthened)

FUNDAMENTAL RULE: No customers yet; all from public sources. For agents/integrations: Start with mocks if needed, but plan/document real setup (e.g., actual API keys for providers; engineers must implement). No fakes beyond prototyping; evidence for all claims \[SOURCE: link/date]. Skeptic reviews all.

CAN Do: Analyze reviews/forums/reports; build hypotheses; use tools for real data (web\_search, x\_keyword\_search).

CANNOT Do: Invent quotes/interviews; mock final integrations—escalate to human for real.
