  "executiveSummary": "\n## Python Integration Decision\n\n**Recommendation**: Defer Python integration\n\n### Rationale:\n• Current JavaScript stack sufficient for MVP features\n• Complexity cost outweighs immediate benefits\n• Market hasn't validated need for advanced ML features\n• Focus on core value delivery with existing stack\n\n### Implementation Approach (if proceeding):\n1. **Phase 1**: Single Python microservice for anomaly detection\n2. **Phase 2**: Expand to model distillation if Phase 1 successful\n3. **Phase 3**: Full ML platform with continuous learning\n\n### Continuous Learning Architecture:\n• **Data Collection**: Event streaming from all user interactions\n• **Model Updates**: Weekly batch training + daily incremental updates\n• **Feedback Loop**: User feedback + automatic success metrics\n• **Expected Improvement**: 95% anomaly detection accuracy within 6 months\n\n### Risk Mitigation:\n• Start small with one critical feature\n• Use containerization for deployment simplicity\n• Hire ML engineer or partner before starting\n• Maintain fallback to JS-only operation\n\n### Decision Factors:\n✅ Do it if: You have customers requesting advanced ML features\n❌ Don't if: Still validating product-market fit\n⏸️ Wait if: Current features satisfy customer needs\n\n**Next Steps**:\n1. Maximize current TypeScript capabilities\n2. Use cloud ML APIs for specific needs\n3. Revisit in 6 months with customer feedback\n"
