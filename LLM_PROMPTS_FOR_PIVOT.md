# Ready-to-Use LLM Prompts for Pivot

## Prompt 1: Expensive Problems for Target Market

```
I have a platform with these capabilities:
- Real-time monitoring and alerts (Socket.io)
- Handle millions of rows of data (TanStack Table with virtualization)
- Beautiful dashboards (Recharts, Lightweight Charts)
- Workflow automation (n8n with 400+ integrations)
- Form builders with validation
- CSV/Excel import/export
- Product tours for onboarding (Intro.js)

What are the top 5 most expensive operational problems that fractional CXOs, solopreneurs, accountants, attorneys, and mid-size companies (under $250M revenue) face that could be solved with these tools?

For each problem, specify:
1. The problem and why it's expensive
2. Current solution they use (if any)
3. How much time/money it wastes monthly
4. How our platform could solve it
5. What they'd pay to fix it
```

## Prompt 2: 24-Hour ROI Product

```
I need a B2B SaaS product idea that provides ROI within 24 hours of installation.

Available tools:
- n8n workflows (connects to QuickBooks, Stripe, Google Workspace, Salesforce, 400+ apps)
- Real-time dashboards and alerts
- Tables that handle millions of records
- Financial charts and visualizations
- Form builders with validation
- CSV upload for initial data import

Requirements:
- Must integrate with tools customers already use
- Solves a problem they face daily
- Shows measurable value in first 24 hours
- Target: companies with 2-50 employees

What product would you build and how would it demonstrate immediate value?
```

## Prompt 3: Automation Opportunities

```
What repetitive tasks do small companies (2-20 employees) and consultants waste the most money on that involve:
- Moving data between systems that don't integrate
- Manual checking/monitoring of multiple dashboards
- Creating reports from multiple data sources
- Tasks that cause expensive mistakes when done manually

I have n8n (workflow automation) and real-time monitoring. Give me 5 specific workflows that would save them 10+ hours per week.
```

## Prompt 4: Platform Positioning

```
I have a platform with enterprise-grade data handling (millions of rows), real-time monitoring, and beautiful visualizations.

Target market: Fractional executives, consultants, accountants, attorneys, companies under $250M revenue.

These buyers care about:
- Looking professional to their clients
- Not dropping balls
- Automating repetitive work
- Having data ready for decisions

What single use case would make them sign up immediately? Give me:
1. The exact problem it solves
2. The "aha moment" in the demo
3. The tagline
4. First 3 features to build
```

## Prompt 5: Integration-First Product

```
Using n8n's ability to connect 400+ tools, design a "command center" product for small business owners that:

1. Pulls data from their existing tools (QuickBooks, Stripe, Google Analytics, CRM, Email)
2. Shows what matters in real-time
3. Alerts them before problems happen
4. Requires zero technical knowledge to use

What specific metrics/automations would make this invaluable? What would they see on login that makes them never want to cancel?
```

## Prompt 6: Consultant's Dream Tool

```
Design a platform specifically for fractional CXOs and consultants that:
- Makes them look incredibly prepared in client meetings
- Automates their client reporting
- Tracks all client metrics in one place
- Bills automatically based on value delivered

Using our tools (real-time dashboards, automation, data handling), what features would let them manage 5x more clients without working more hours?
```

## Prompt 7: The "Excel Killer"

```
Many businesses run on spreadsheets that are:
- Error-prone
- Not real-time
- Don't talk to other systems
- Break when someone leaves

Design a platform that replaces their most critical spreadsheets with:
- Real-time data from their actual systems
- Automatic validation and error checking
- Beautiful visualizations
- Audit trails

What specific spreadsheet/process should we target first for maximum impact?
```

## How to Use These Prompts

1. **Send one at a time** to different LLMs (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini)
2. **Compare answers** - look for overlapping themes
3. **Drill deeper** - ask follow-ups on promising ideas
4. **Validate** - "Would you pay $99/month for this?"
5. **Pick winner** - Choose based on:
   - Easiest to build with current tools
   - Clearest value proposition
   - Shortest sales cycle
   - Your excitement level

## The Ultimate Test

After getting answers, ask:
"If this product existed today exactly as described, what would prevent someone from buying it immediately?"

This reveals hidden objections to address in Phase 1.
