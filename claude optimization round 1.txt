Key Optimization Opportunities:
1. FLEXSEARCH-FIRST Enforcement (Critical)
The documents emphasize searching for existing solutions but could be stronger:

Add automated pre-commit hooks that block code without FlexSearch proof
Create a .flexsearch-check file requirement for each PR
Implement a "BUILD_JUSTIFICATION.md" requirement when building custom

2. Low-Code/No-Code Enforcement (Needs Strengthening)
Current gaps:

No mandatory v0.dev usage tracking
Missing "tool-first" checklist enforcement
No automated rejection for hand-coded UI components

Suggested additions:
markdown## MANDATORY NO-CODE CHECKLIST
Before ANY code:
□ v0.dev attempted for UI? (paste prompt used)
□ Zapier/Make.com checked for integrations?
□ Retool evaluated for admin panels?
□ Bubble considered for prototypes?
□ Evidence documented in PR description
3. Prompt Engineering Templates (Should be Expanded)
The PROMPT_ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md could include:

Copy-paste ready templates for common tasks
"Magic phrases" that reduce hallucinations
Failure recovery prompts

4. Hardware Utilization (Under-leveraged)
With 256GB RAM and RTX 5070 Ti:

Not using RAM disk for development
Missing GPU-accelerated linting/formatting
No parallel type-checking configuration

5. Tool Registry Automation
Manual tool awareness could be automated:
bash# Auto-generate from package.json
pnpm tools:scan > AVAILABLE_TOOLS.md
pnpm tools:unused # Flag installed but unused
Recommended Immediate Actions:

Add to ORCHESTRATOR_DIRECTIVES.md:

markdown## ZERO-CODE MANDATE
1. UI Components → v0.dev ONLY
2. Integrations → Zapier/Make FIRST
3. Admin Panels → Retool REQUIRED
4. Proof of attempt MANDATORY in PR

Create AUTO_REJECTION.md:

markdown## Instant PR Rejection Triggers
- No FlexSearch proof
- Hand-coded UI without v0.dev attempt
- Custom auth/payment/email code
- Missing tool justification

Enhance conciseness rules - Current rules are good but could add:

markdown## ULTRA-CONCISE MODE
- Max 50 words per response unless requested
- Code blocks without explanation
- Single emoji acknowledgments when appropriate
Should optimize? Yes - stronger enforcement of no-code/low-code principles would accelerate development significantly. The 80% reduction target is achievable with stricter tool-first mandates.
