## Research Agent Coordination

### Communication Protocol
```markdown
RESEARCH REQUEST: [Orchestrator → Research Agent]
AREA: Authentication
PRIORITY: High
DELIVERABLE: Comparison matrix with recommendations
DEADLINE: EOD today

RESEARCH UPDATE: [Research Agent → Orchestrator]
STATUS: 50% complete
FINDINGS: Preliminary results favor Clerk for DX
BLOCKERS: Need cost data for 100K+ users
NEXT: Analyzing security features
```

### Collaboration Points
- Auth + Database researchers: Session management
- Payment + Database researchers: Transaction tracking
- AI + Infrastructure researchers: Edge computing for tokens
- All researchers: Cost optimization strategies

## Decision Framework
