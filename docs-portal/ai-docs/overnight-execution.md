## Phase 2: Market Research (11:45 PM - 1:00 AM)

### Research Questions for AI Services

#### For ChatGPT-4:
```
PROMPT 1: "You're a CFO at a 100-person company spending $15K/month across OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google AI. What dashboard metrics would help you optimize this spend by 30%?"

PROMPT 2: "What are the top 5 reasons companies overspend on AI APIs? Provide specific examples with dollar amounts."

PROMPT 3: "Design the ideal AI expense management tool for a company. What are the must-have features vs nice-to-have?"
```

#### For Claude 3.5:
```
PROMPT 1: "As a solopreneur spending $800/month on AI tools, what features would convince you to switch from subscriptions (ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro) to API usage with a tracking tool?"

PROMPT 2: "What technical challenges exist in building a unified token tracking system across OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Mistral APIs?"

PROMPT 3: "How would you architect a real-time AI cost optimization system that automatically routes prompts to the cheapest capable model?"
```

#### For Perplexity:
```
PROMPT 1: "Research all existing AI cost management and observability tools in 2024. What features do they offer and what's missing?"

PROMPT 2: "What are enterprises currently spending on AI services monthly? Provide data by company size and industry."

PROMPT 3: "What integrations (Slack, Zapier, QuickBooks, etc.) would make an AI expense tool indispensable for businesses?"
```

#### For Grok:
```
PROMPT 1: "What unconventional features would make an AI expense tracker go viral among startups and developers?"

PROMPT 2: "How could gamification make AI cost optimization engaging for teams?"

PROMPT 3: "What's the one feature that would make this tool a must-have instead of nice-to-have for CTOs?"
```

## Phase 3: Feature Validation (1:00 AM - 3:00 AM)

### Core Features to Validate

1. **Unified Dashboard**
   - Question: "Would you pay $49/month for a dashboard showing all AI costs in one place?"
   - Expected Value: Time saved, reduced overspend

2. **Smart Model Routing**
   - Question: "If a tool could automatically route to GPT-3.5 instead of GPT-4 when appropriate, saving 40%, would you use it?"
   - Technical Implementation: Edge function proxy

3. **Team Analytics**
   - Question: "How important is tracking AI usage by department/project?"
   - Use Case: Marketing vs Engineering vs Sales

4. **Cache System**
   - Question: "23% of API calls are duplicates. Would automated caching be valuable?"
   - Savings Potential: $500-2000/month for average company

5. **Budget Alerts**
   - Question: "What alerts would prevent AI bill surprises?"
   - Types: Daily limits, unusual spikes, tier approaching

## Phase 4: Prototype Development (3:00 AM - 5:00 AM)
