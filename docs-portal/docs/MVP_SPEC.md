# MVP Specification V3: AI Cost Optimization Platform
**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Phase**: Final - Ready for Implementation
**Focus**: From "AI Cost Tracker" to "AI Cost Optimizer"

## Executive Summary
Meterr helps companies discover where they're overpaying for AI and provides actionable recommendations to reduce costs without sacrificing quality. Using privacy-preserving pattern detection, we identify optimization opportunities and validate savings through business metrics.

## Market Opportunity
**Key Insight**: Companies using GPT-4 for everything are overpaying by 70-90% for simple tasks that could use cheaper models.

**The Problem**:
- Companies spend $10,000+/month on AI with no optimization
- OpenAI dashboard shows usage but not opportunities
- Fear of breaking things prevents model switching
- No way to validate quality after changes

**Our Solution**:
- Identify where cheaper models would work fine
- Provide implementation code/config
- Validate quality didn't drop
- Charge only 20% of what we save

## Core Value Proposition

### The Pitch
"Smarter AI usage. Lower costs. Pay only for proven savings."
