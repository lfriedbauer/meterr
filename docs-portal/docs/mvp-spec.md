# MVP Specification V2: AI Profitability Platform
**Date**: 2025-01-14  
**Phase**: 2 - Feature Prioritization & Platform Evolution
**Pivot**: From "AI Cost Tracker" to "AI Profitability Platform"

## Executive Summary
Based on comprehensive market analysis, meterr pivots from pure cost tracking to become the first AI profitability platform - answering not just "what does AI cost?" but "is AI profitable for my business?"

## Market Opportunity
**Key Insight**: No competitor connects AI costs to business outcomes. All focus on technical metrics without answering the CFO's question: "What's the ROI?"

**Competitive Gap**:
- Helicone/Langfuse: Engineering observability only
- Portkey/Vellum: Gateway and routing focus
- OpenMeter: Usage-based billing
- **Meterr**: Business profitability focus

## Core Value Proposition
