## Key Selling Points

### For Small Customers (Starter/Growth)
"Our base fee pays for itself in the first week. Everything after that is pure profit for you."

### For Enterprise
"We're the only vendor who loses money if we don't save you money. Our success is literally tied to yours."

### For Skeptics
"Try our 30-day pilot at just the base fee. We'll establish your baseline, show you the savings, then you decide if the performance model makes sense."
