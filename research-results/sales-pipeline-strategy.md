## Revenue Projections

### Conservative Scenario:

- Month 6: $10,000 (audits + 20 monthly clients)
- Month 12: $25,000 (mix of service + product)
- **Year 1 Total**: $150,000

### Realistic Scenario:

- Month 12: $35,000 MRR
- **Year 1 Total**: $250,000

## The Bottom Line

**Stop building, start selling.**

The consulting model proves there's demand at $299/month for AI cost optimization. Use that cash flow to build a product that scales. This approach:

1. Generates revenue immediately
2. Validates the market with real money
3. Funds product development
4. Builds a customer base before launch
5. Creates case studies and social proof

**Next Step**: Pick 10 companies spending >$5K/month on AI and offer them a free cost analysis this week. Close 2 audits. You'll have $3K in revenue before writing a line of code.

This is your path to a sales pipeline.
